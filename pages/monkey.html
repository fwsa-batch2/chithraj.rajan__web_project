Every day, the monkeys look for fruits and leaves in the forest. But Tungtung didn't want to bother. If he is hungry, he prefers to go to the nearest village around the forest. Usually he will steal any food that is in people's homes.
One day, Tungtung found a piece of candy in the living room of a resident's house. The candy spilled out of the candy jar. Hm..comfortable when eaten. It tastes sweet like sugar. Wow, that's great. Tungtung jumped happily. Only then did he eat candy. In the forest there can be no food as delicious as this candy, thought Tungtung. Tungtung was so tempted. Want to eat as much candy as possible.
"Ah, if you eat one candy you won't taste it. I'll just take all the candy that is in this jar," thought Tungtung. Uh, the hole in the candy jar is very small. The candy can only be removed by inserting two fingers to clamp it. It was difficult for Tungtung's hand to get into it. At that time, the owner of the house came to catch him. The owner of the house immediately beat Tungtung to a pulp.</h2></td></tr>
